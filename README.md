# Computer Science Data Structures and Algorithms

Based on [Vaidehi Joshi's series of articles, BaseCS](https://medium.com/basecs).  I tried to implement all of the different things in Ruby to help me remember them and understand them.

## Feedback?

I'm currently doing a deep dive to learn and get fluent-er in idiomatic Ruby.  See something that I could be doing better?  Something not the "ruby way?"  Let me know, because I'd love to hear about it.  Probably the easiest way is to just file an issue.  Thanks for sharing your sage wisdom!

## Running the tests

For ease of reading and file structure, all my tests just use Minitest and are underneath the classes in the various files (e.g. LinkedListTest is in the same file as LinkedList, underneath).  To run the tests after cloning the repository, run

```bash
$ # gem install rake  (if needed)
$ rake
```
